                <p>
                    I'm Justin, and the Logical Sloth isn't just a name‚Äîit's a lifestyle. We're often told to move fast, break things, and embrace the hustle. But here, we challenge that. I believe the fastest route to the *right* answer is often the slowest route of all, one paved with **tinkering**, **pondering**, and **intentional relaxing**. I'm really just a guy who prefers deep, focused engagement over surface-level sprints.
